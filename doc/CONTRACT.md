### Team Contract

We will expect each other to work consistently on our project, and front-load our work to the beginning of each sprint. Communication is key. We will create a [task-tracking system](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11FaTKxmpqZN-wYOsoiqJvDP3LmAJSurGGHqMblpMS40/edit?usp=sharing), update one another in the group chat, and schedule regular video call meetings. We will use the group chat to schedule meetings, but discuss code “in person.” Everyone will be present at and contribute to every meeting. This is a team project and we should all ask each other for help when applicable. We should all stay up to date with class material/lectures. Our video meetings will start with a Stand Up meeting: what have you done, what are you working on, what do you need help with. We should all comment on our code as we go so other team members can interpret it. Have fun! XP
